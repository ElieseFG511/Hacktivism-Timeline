             <h2>Worst out for Best</h2>

             <p>Since the early 90’s hacktivism has been an integral part of the history of the internet, whether it would be declaring “cyberwars” on countries to creating the means to initiate Distribution Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. With time, however, attacks have gotten more complex, risque, controversial, but have diminished within size and seem to be less effective than ever. This has all but faded into obscurity in the wake of authoritarian view almost, though that does seem to be speculation as that is what they do fight typically. Groups tend to be anarchistic in their design, not to cause chaos, but to distribute the power to as many as possible so that their cause may be larger than a city, state, country, or world.</p>
             <p>The rise of groups such as Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) still have active websites that have possibly haven’t changed since the early 90’s. Some groups, such as anonymous, have shut down their youtube pages, and have faded from the mainstream as powers have changed. Some simply remain legends and are meant to be, we shouldn’t fear or revere them, but we should know what they’ve done for us.</p>

              <p>The fictional hacktivist group allegedly found holes within the Chinese internet system, specifically with the use of satellite communications. Their goal was to beat China’s firewall to destroy the censorship for the People’s Republic of China’s people, as well as target U.S. businesses that were partnering with China. Unknowingly, and allegedly, created by the United States Government.</p>
