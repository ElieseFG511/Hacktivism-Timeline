               <h2>Worst out for Best</h2>

               <p>Since the early 90’s hacktivism has been an integral part of the history of the internet, whether it would be declaring “cyberwars” on countries to creating the means to initiate Distribution Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. With time, however, attacks have gotten more complex, risque, controversial, but have diminished within size and seem to be less effective than ever. This has all but faded into obscurity in the wake of authoritarian view almost, though that does seem to be speculation as that is what they do fight typically. Groups tend to be anarchistic in their design, not to cause chaos, but to distribute the power to as many as possible so that their cause may be larger than a city, state, country, or world.</p>
               <p>The rise of groups such as Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) still have active websites that have possibly haven’t changed since the early 90’s. Some groups, such as anonymous, have shut down their youtube pages, and have faded from the mainstream as powers have changed. Some simply remain legends and are meant to be, we shouldn’t fear or revere them, but we should know what they’ve done for us.</p>

Their goal was to beat China’s firewall to destroy the censorship for the People’s Republic of China’s people, as well as target U.S. businesses that were partnering with China. Unknowingly, and allegedly, created by the United States Government.</p>

FloodNet took the form of a Java Applet and it allowed users to send absolutely useless requests or even personalized messages to the server. Slowing it down to a crawl and filling with error logs. This served as a “virtual Sit-in” which can cripple a targeted organization if they can’t handle the load.</p>

            <p>An alliance between Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc), L0pht, Chaos Computer Club, Hacker Mags 2600 and Phrack rose into the public view. They called themselves the “Legion of the Underground”, and they declared a cyberwar against China and Iraq in retaliation to their numerous human right’s violations. There was criticism as this possibly impeded the free access to information, for the citizens of China.</p>
