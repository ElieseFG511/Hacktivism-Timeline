               <p>Since the early 90’s hacktivism has been an integral part of the history of the internet, whether it would be <a href="#98-2">declaring “cyberwars” on countries</a> to even <a href="#11-1">encouraging dissent against unfair policies</a>. With time, however, attacks have gotten more complex, risque, controversial, but have diminished within size and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hacktivism-sudan-ddos-protest/">seem to be less effective than ever</a>. This has all but faded into obscurity in the wake of recent authoritarian views. Groups tend to be anarchistic in their design, not to cause chaos, but to distribute the power to as many as possible so that their cause may be larger than a city, state, country, or world.</p>

Some groups, such as anonymous, have shut down their youtube pages, and have faded from the mainstream as powers have changed. Some simply remain legends and are meant to be, we shouldn’t fear or revere them, but we should know what they’ve done for us.</p>

FloodNet took the form of a Java Applet and it allowed users to send absolutely useless requests or even personalized messages to the server. Slowing it down to a crawl and filling with error logs. This served as a “virtual Sit-in” which can cripple a targeted organization if they can’t handle the load.</p>
