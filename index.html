             <h2>Worst out for Best</h2>

             <p>Since the early 90’s hacktivism has been an integral part of the history of the internet, whether it would be declaring “cyberwars” on countries to creating the means to initiate Distribution Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. With time, however, attacks have gotten more complex, risque, controversial, but have diminished within size and seem to be less effective than ever. This has all but faded into obscurity in the wake of authoritarian view almost, though that does seem to be speculation as that is what they do fight typically. Groups tend to be anarchistic in their design, not to cause chaos, but to distribute the power to as many as possible so that their cause may be larger than a city, state, country, or world.</p>
             <p>The rise of groups such as Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) still have active websites that have possibly haven’t changed since the early 90’s. Some groups, such as anonymous, have shut down their youtube pages, and have faded from the mainstream as powers have changed. Some simply remain legends and are meant to be, we shouldn’t fear or revere them, but we should know what they’ve done for us.</p>

            <p>The fictional hacktivist group allegedly found holes within the Chinese internet system, specifically with the use of satellite communications. Their goal was to beat China’s firewall to destroy the censorship for the People’s Republic of China’s people, as well as target U.S. businesses that were partnering with China. Unknowingly, and allegedly, created by the United States Government.</p>

            <p>Unknown hackers got onto the Department of injustice, changing the title to the “Department of Injustice” putting explicit images in response to the “Communications Decency Act”. This law tried to restrict the access of pornographic materials on the internet, which after this attack backfired in the following year after a court ruling decided that was unconstitutional.</p>

            <p>Members of the EDT created FloodNet, which allows users to create DDoS attacks to help rebels in Chiapas. FloodNet took the form of a Java Applet and it allowed users to send absolutely useless requests or even personalized messages to the server. Slowing it down to a crawl and filling with error logs. This served as a “virtual Sit-in” which can cripple a targeted organization if they can’t handle the load.</p>

            <p>An alliance between Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc), L0pht, Chaos Computer Club, Hacker Mags 2600 and Phrack rose into the public view. They called themselves the “Legion of the Underground”, and they declared a cyberwar against China and Iraq in retaliation to their numerous human right’s violations. There was criticism as this possibly impeded the free access to information, for the citizens of China.</p>

            <p>A hacker of the name Kaka hacked into the Ugandan State House’s website and posted onto it an image of Adolf Hitler. The image had stayed on the site for more than twenty-four hours without real notice or response. The reason for this is unknown but could be in protest of the hosting provider as it is suspected that an ex-employee had done it to get the company in hot water.</p>
